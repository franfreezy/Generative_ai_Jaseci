# Building AI Applications with Jac
---

## Why Jac
- Extends Pythonâ€™s semantics while maintaining full interoperability with the Python ecosystem.  
- Introduces cutting-edge abstractions designed to reduce complexity and embrace AI-forward development.  

---

## Jac for AI
- A function body can be directly replaced with a call to an LLM, removing the need for prompt engineering or additional libraries.  
- **Powerful by `llm()`**  

---

## The `by llm()`
- Delegates execution to an LLM without requiring extra library code.  

---

## Acknowledgements
- Learning and building with Jac, with guidance from Prof. Mars of the University of Michigan and President Jaseci Labs.
